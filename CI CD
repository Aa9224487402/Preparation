12. GIT HUB
GitHub is an online platform for version control and collaborative software development, enabling teams and individuals to store, manage, and track changes to their code repositories,
 and facilitating collaboration through features like pull requests, issue tracking, and code review.
 13. GIT VS GIT HUB
     Git: Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase, 
	 collaborate with others, and manage code repositories locally on their computers. It is not a web-based platform.

    GitHub: GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform built around Git.
	It provides a cloud-based environment for hosting, sharing, and collaborating on Git repositories. GitHub offers features such as pull requests, issue tracking, and a web-based interface for managing Git repositories, 
	making it a popular choice for distributed software development and version control.

    VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): VPC is a virtual network that you can define
	within a cloud provider like AWS. It allows you to logically isolate your cloud resources, control their network settings, and connect them securely to the internet or other VPCs.

    Route Table: A route table is a configuration that defines how network
	traffic should be directed within a VPC or between a VPC and external networks. It specifies routes and their destinations, helping determine 
	where data should be forwarded.

    15.
	CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing): CIDR is a method for allocating 
	and specifying IP addresses and routing information. It allows for more efficient use of IP address space by using a prefix length notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) to represent a network's address range and subnet mask.
	
	    HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web and typically uses port 80 for unencrypted web traffic.

    HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure): HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP, encrypting data transfer, and it usually uses port 443.

    RDS (Relational Database Service): RDS is a managed database service by AWS. It typically uses port 3306 for MySQL, 5432 for PostgreSQL, and others for various database engines.

    SSH (Secure Shell): SSH is a secure protocol for remote access to a server or computer. It commonly uses port 22 for secure shell connections.
