Architecture of Kubernetes (K8s): Kubernetes is an orchestration platform with a master-worker
 architecture. The master controls cluster operations, while worker nodes run containerized applications in pods.
 
 
 
 Steps for Docker Architecture: Docker uses a client-server architecture. You create Docker images with the Docker CLI, 
 and the Docker daemon (server) manages containers, running instances of those images.
 
 Node, Pod, Master(Kubernetes Architecture): In Kubernetes, a node is a worker machine,
 a pod is the smallest deployable unit,
 the master controls the cluster,
 worker nodes are used instead.
 
 
 Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service provided by Docker 
 for sharing container images. It serves as a central repository for Docker images, 
 allowing developers to store, share, and distribute their containerized applications. 
 Here are some key aspects of Docker Hub:
 
 A Dockerfile is a script used to create a Docker image. It contains a set of instructions 
 that Docker uses to automatically perform tasks when building a Docker image.
 Docker images are the packaged and distributable
 runtime environment for a specific application, 
 including the application code, libraries, dependencies, and runtime.
